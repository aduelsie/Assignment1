7. The RoleGame prototype is using polymorphism because as defined earlier,
Polymorphism is the ability to have an entity, such as a variable or object,
to have more than one form. For example, we have the base class Weapon. This
class enables us to define different methods of derived classes from weapons
such as Simple Axe or Common Spear. So that it doesn't matter what weapon we
send into the Weapon class, the correct results are always returned.

It also uses encapsulation since we have Public and Protected methods and
variables in our classes. The Weapon class is another example as it returns
the hitpoints and names of a derived Weapon class with setter and getter
functions, instead of being able to directly retrieve the variable.
